## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling:

An employee has a resume and a resume belongs to an employee.
```

Employees have many projects to work on and projects are worked on by many employees.

## Release 5: Reflection

```
This was a straight forward exercise with clear explanations on how to design schemas based on the
different relationsip models available. I had a little difficulty on how to use the 'foreign key' to
create relationships between the given tables, but overall an easy exercise.
```
